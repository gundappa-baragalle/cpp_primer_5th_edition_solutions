# C++ Primer (5th Edition) Solutions

This repository contains all the code I've written while working through the book. 

It includes:

- Solutions to all the exercises given in the book
- In-text programs
- Other programs I've written to test various aspects of C++

NOTE: All programs are written in a format that is easy to run, even for someone without coding knowledge or without seeing the code just with binary file.
